about_first_paragraph: "The Kasparo is found in an enchanting leafy green arched square in the very centre of Barcelona, just a stone’s throw from the emblematic but busy Rambles and the frenetic commercial activity of the city."
about_second_paragraph: "It is a traditionally well known meeting point of cosmopolitan people searching for a little peace and quiet in a green sunny square, totally free of traffic and commerce."
about_third_paragraph: "The Kasparo provides a good coffee or a choice of black and natural herbal teas, a good choice of healthy breakfasts, homemade cakes and deserts, a variety of innovative sandwiches, a selection of local artisanal beers, wines from limited productions, cocktail granites, but above all, a choice of tapas and original dishes of the day with an unchanging emphasis on fresh and seasonal produce."
about_fourth_paragraph: "Drawing from a Mediterranean and international cuisine,  a variety of fixed tapas are offered on the menu together with the plates of the day, like the salad, the vegetables, the dip, the Italian pasta, the hot meat dish, the soup, and the quiche made from free range eggs, all of which change every day, according to the season."
about_fifth_paragraph: "To highlight just a few of the  favorite choices are the hot potato wedges with a homemade tomato sauce and sour cream, the hummus, the polpette di ricotta with homemade relish, the avocado, brie and sun dried tomato sandwich, the carrot cake and the hot sticky date pudding."
